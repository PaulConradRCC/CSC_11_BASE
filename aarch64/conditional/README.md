Conditional branching directory has been removed as it was a duplicate from the Branching directory.

Since ARM64 (aarch64) does not have conditional execution like ARM32, the conditional execution instructions
are left commented out for historical purposes. 

All of the source files in this directory and subdirectories have been rewritten to carry out the same
programmatic results but how it can be done in ARM64.
